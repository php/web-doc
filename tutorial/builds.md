# The PHP Manual builds

The PHP Manual is written in [DocBook][docbook] and built by [PhD][phd], and
these builds are rsynced to the web servers for users to use.

## Mirror builds
The [rsync box][rsync.php.net] builds the manuals every night, at around 05:00 UTC.
The web servers then pick up these builds when they sync, which usually happens every hour.

## Doc server builds
The [docs development server][docs.php.net] builds the manual six times a day
(every 4 hours, starting at midnight UTC). This takes place on the [euk2][euk2] server.
An easy way to see when each translation was last built, is to look at the
[doc downloads page with dates][download-docs]. Also note that several old
translations reside on this particular server, as it attempts to build every
translation (both active and inactive).

## CHM builds
The CHM version of the manual is built on a Windows machine and pulled on Fridays,
for distribution to web servers. [Richard][rquadling] maintains these builds.

## Validation
Aside from running `php configure.php â€“with-lang=foo` (see [editing](editing.php))
for a language, another way to check if the docs validated is by looking at build
dates on the doc server. See "Doc server builds", above.

## Additional notes
- If a manual does not validate on some day, it will not be pushed to the web servers
  until it does validate (hopefully, the next day).
- Only active translations are built on rsync box (and then pushed to regular
  mirrors). This is managed in [web/php/includes/languages.inc][languages.inc]
- [docs.php.net][docs.php.net] attempts to build all translations (both active
  and inactive). However, we use a `broken-language.txt` file in root of broken
  translations to disable those that are very outdated and failing to build
  for a long time.

## The humans who manage these
If there is a problem with the synced builds, it's wise to contact
[Derick][derick] or [Hannes][bjori].
If a problem exists on the development server ([docs.php.net][docs.php.net]),
then contact [Peter][salathe] or the [documentation team mailing list][phpdoc-list].
